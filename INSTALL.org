* Install

GNRest API currently uses Grape + Rack. Install Grape and run

    rackup

in the checked out source repository. When running curl it should
respond with ok:

: curl http://localhost:9292/api/status/server/
:   "ok"

when running without a database it should respond in testmode

: curl http://localhost:9292/api/status/database
:   "testmode"
